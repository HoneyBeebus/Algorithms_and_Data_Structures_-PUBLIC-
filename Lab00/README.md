# Find Max and Min
## Description
This lab is indented to help you understand how you should test and submit your own code. Therefore, we provide a solution (yourid.cpp). This lab will be worth ZERO points but we still strongly encourage you to submit your code to see if youâ€™ve completely understood how submission and grading work.

## Input Structure
The input starts with an integer number which indicates the number of elements (integers) in the input sequence, n. Then, the elements in the sequence follow, one per line.

## Output Structure
Output the maximum of all numbers in the sequence, followed by a semi- colon and the minimum number. There should be no white character in your output.

## Examples of Input and Output:

*Input*
```
6
15
13
12
11
16
14
```
*Output*
```
16;11
